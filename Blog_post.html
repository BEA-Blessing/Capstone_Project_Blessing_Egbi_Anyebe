                <p>A Man would be strategic a Woman would be manipulative </p>
                <p>A Man would be a leader a Woman will be controlling <br>
                    A Man would be authoritative a Woman would be annoying <br>
                    A Man would be called confident but a Woman would be called arrogant <br>
                    A Man would be uncompromising a Woman would be a ball-breaker <br>
                    A Man would be assertive a Woman would be aggressive <br>
                    The behavior is the same, what is different is the body exibiting that behavior. </p>

                <p>And so i began to see that when people judged a Woman for being aggressive or ambitious or annoying, <br>
                    it really wasn`t the quanlities of ambition or aggression that they where judging, <br> it was actually women that were being judged. <br>
                    So we should change laws that diminishes Women, but changing mindset is even more important. <br>
                    we should enact policies that support women, but changing culture atitude is even more important. <br>

                <h2>Women's Mental Health: A Silent Struggle</h2>
                <p>Breaking the Stigma </p>

                <p>Women's mental health is a topic that has been gaining increasing attention in recent years, but it's still often overlooked or misunderstood. Despite the progress made, there's a persistent stigma surrounding mental health issues, especially among women. It's time to break this silence and shed light on the unique challenges women face.</p>
                <input type="checkbox" id="expand-content-3" class="expand-checkbox expandable-content">
                 <div class="more-content">
                <p>The Unique Challenges Faced by Women
                    
                    Women are disproportionately affected by mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Several factors contribute to this disparity:
                    
                    Hormonal fluctuations: Hormonal changes throughout a woman's life, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can impact mental health.
                    Caregiver burden: Women often take on the role of primary caregiver for children, elderly parents, or sick family members, leading to increased stress and burnout.
                    Gender roles and expectations: Societal pressures and stereotypes can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and stress for women.
                    Discrimination and violence: Women are more likely to experience discrimination and violence, which can have a devastating impact on mental health.
                    Prioritizing Self-Care
                    
                    It's essential for women to prioritize their mental health. Here are some self-care practices that can help:
                    
                    Seeking professional help: Don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist or counselor if you're struggling.
                    Building a support system: Surround yourself with supportive friends and family.
                    Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Meditation, yoga, and deep breathing can help reduce stress.
                    Setting boundaries: Learn to say no and prioritize your own needs.
                    Taking breaks: Make time for activities you enjoy and that help you recharge.
                    Breaking the Silence
                    
                    Open conversations about mental health are crucial to reducing stigma. By sharing our experiences and supporting others, we can create a more supportive environment for women.
                    
                    Remember, you're not alone. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please reach out for help.</p>
